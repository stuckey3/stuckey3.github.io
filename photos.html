		<h1> <center><b>A Summer In The Rockie Mountains </b></center></h1>
		<p> </p><center>For the duration of the summer 0f 2021 I worked as a camp counselor for Camp Granite Lake. A blink you might miss it safehaven in the foothills of Boulder CO. where kids could engulf themselves in a authentic and welcoming setting. Kids could explore and develop skills in outdoor activites while creating frienships and connections with others. As a Camp Counselor I honed practical skills as a leader, well practiced communicator, and got to feed my adventourous spirit in a environment that allowed me to follow my love for the outdoors. When I wasn't teaching kids how to rock climb or kayak through local rivers, I was able to venture off in to the mountains of Colorado and first-handly experience the plethora of natural beauty the great state offers.  </center> <p></p>

		<h1> <center>Roadtrip Out West</center></h1>
		<p> </p><center>In the summer of 2020, me and four of my friends went on a two week roadtrip. This tripped spanned states such as South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. We went to several landmark sites such as the Grand Tetons, Zion National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Black Hills. It was a trip of strenous hikes with beautiful views, subpar campfire food, and great memories. Here are some pictures of me my pals enjoying the picterque nature that our country has to offer. </center> <p></p>
