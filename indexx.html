			<p>Hello my name is Sam Stuckey. I am a Junior at UW-Madison majoring in Marketing with a certificate in Digital Studies. I am looking to explore opportunities in the area of creative/content marketing. As a student at the University of Wisconsin I have exercised my interests in this area by forming a mental health organization on campus called ManUP where I have taken all of the marketing and social media responsibilities. I am also a part of a professional business fraternity called Alpha Kappa Psi where I have learned valuable hard skills that are crucial in the business world as well as utilize my pre-existing knowledge of Adobe Premiere to make the rush video for the spring semester of 2021.

		<p>In my free time I can be found exploring the world of movies and music. Some of my favorite artists are Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, LCD Soundsystem, and Twin Peaks. While some of my favorite movies are Shawshank Redemption, The Royal Tenenbaums, and 500 Days of Summer. My love for movies and music has driven me to create my own publication called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/folk.horn/?hl=en" class="link" target="_blank"> Folkhorn</a>, where me and my roommate create videos, interview artists, and write articles about mediums of art that inspire us. This medium of expression has allowed me to take on projects that are fine tuned to my interests but teach me valuable lessons in the realm of video production, investigative journalism, and graphic design.
